  <!-- =========================================================
       SECTION 2 — RULES TEXT (UNCHANGED)
       ========================================================= -->
  <script id="rulesText" type="text/plain">
=== Voice Channels and Calls (VC) ===
~ Voice channels are just like text channels if it was a call.

> Keep it usable
You aren't allowed to use loud noises, soundboards, voice distortion, mic spam, or any type of audio that disrupts the ability to speak or listen to others.

> Speak like a normal person
Keep your mic level reasonable. If your mic is peaking, blasting music, or you have constant background noise, you must fix it by using some of Discord's features (push-to-talk, noise suppression, move away, lower gain) or simply mute yourself or leave the VC.

What counts as disruptive in VC:
- Spam-like behavior with your audio (e.g. constant interruption of others) or text spam in the voice chat.
- “Ragebaiting” or “jokes” if somebody is uncomfortable with it.
- Soundboard spam or making noises without contributing to conversation.
- Yelling, mic screaming, audio jump-scares, or sudden loud playback.
- Playing music/video through your mic unless everyone in the call agrees.
- Joining/leaving repeatedly to create notification spam.

> Streams and screen share
If you’re streaming/screen sharing, you are responsible for what appears on screen and what’s heard.
- Don’t show inappropriate content, personal information, or “edgy” clips.
- Don’t “accidentally” flash things and brush it off. If it happens, stop immediately.
- Don’t use stream to humiliate, expose, or target someone.

> Recording calls
If you’re recording a call with audio/cameras on, every participant must consent first.
This can be bypassed ONLY if the recording is strictly for proof to report someone. In that case, keep it private and only send it to staff or Avenue Guard. Do not post recordings publicly.

If anyone is being annoying or breaking rules, ping staff or DM Avenue Guard with evidence (recordings).


=== Harassment, Hate, and Targeting (harassment) ===
~ No targeted bullying, slurs, or repeated hostility.

GD Avenue is not a place for targeted harassment, hate speech, or demeaning stereotypes.
"It was just a joke" does not matter if the result is someone being singled out, pressured, or made uncomfortable.

> Consent matters
Friendly teasing is only ok if BOTH sides clearly agree, and it stops the moment it’s unwanted.

> Dogpiling is still harassment
Even if each message is "small", it becomes harassment when multiple people pile on one person to mock, pressure, or interrogate.

> Ragebaiting is treated as harassment
Trying to provoke reactions (even "for fun") counts as harassment when it targets a person or makes the space uncomfortable.

This includes but is not limited to:
- Slurs, identity-based insults, or "ironic" hate.
- Persistent mocking about skill, voice, accent, appearance, or personal life.
- Sexual comments toward someone who didn’t invite it (or a minor).
- "Jokes" that keep going after someone says stop.
- Threats, intimidation, or "you should leave" type behavior.
- Pressuring someone to reveal personal info, face, voice, location, age...

If a conflict is escalating, step away. If you need help, contact staff with context calmly.


=== Text Channels and Message Quality (chat) ===
~ Keep conversations readable and meaningful.

> Contribute something
Short reactions are fine, but repeated "nothing messages" that add no value (like “ok”, “lol”, and “W”) or constant derailing will be treated as disruption.

Low-effort disruption includes:
- Repeating the same message, copypasting, or memes over and over.
- Flooding a channel with one line messages or textwalls.
- Excessive caps, excessive markdown, excessive emojis, or fake "announcements" to grab attention.
- Posting to reset the chat or to stop other discussions.

If staff asks you to slow down, stop. If they ask you to move topics, do it immediately.


=== Media and Attachments (media) ===
~ Post media where they belong and keep them reasonable.

> Don’t use media as spam
Even if something isn’t explicitly NSFW, it can still be disruptive if it’s excessive, disturbing, or posted just to annoy.

Not allowed:
- Dumping lots of images/gifs/videos in a row.
- Reposting the same attachment after it already got ignored.
- Using flashing content or loud audios to disrupt (especially in VC) without a fair warning and easy avoidability.
- Posting bait images designed to start drama.

If a channel has specific posting rules (like the creator-points channel), follow them.

=== Advertising, Invites, and Self-Promo (promo) ===
~ Don’t turn the server (or people’s DMs) into a billboard.

> Ask first, post where allowed
Not allowed:
- Server Invites (Unless we specifically partner with that server)
- Advertising in non-designated channels.
- Sending invites, self-promo, or recruitment messages in random DMs.
- Sneaky ads (like my level, surveys, join my server, referral links, "my friend needs members").
- Repeatedly bringing up your content after people show no interest.

Even in designated channels, keep promotion occasional and don’t ping people for it.


=== Politics and Religion (topics) ===
~ Keep heated debates out of the server.

> Don’t start it, don’t fuel it
This includes:
- Political memes meant to bait reactions.
- "Just discussing news" that turns into arguing.
- Religious debates or attacking beliefs.
- Campaigning, slogans, or trying to convert people.

If a topic drifts into politics/religion, drop it. Staff can shut it down at any time.

On the other hand, take into account that you can:
- Mention specific religious/philosophical references IF on-topic and not targeted.
- Talk about specific groups or personal takes that aren't part of a clear, present, recognized political agenda (like the LGTBIAQ+ movement)
- Reflect on identity, situation, or personal beliefs and debate with others from an empathetic and respectful point of view.

Golden rule: If you doubt about saying something, don't say it. 

=== Language and Translation (language) ===
~ Keep shared spaces understandable.

In the general chat, messages must be in English. In the Spanish chat, messages must be in Spanish.
If something important must be posted in another language, include an English translation in the same message (or right after).

Not allowed:
- Extended non-English conversations in the general chat.
- Using another language specifically to exclude, mock, or provoke others.
- Difficulting communication through self-imposed language barriers.


=== Bots, Commands, and Automation (bots) ===
~ Bots are tools, not toys.

Not allowed:
- Command spam that floods chat.
- Triggering bots repeatedly.
- Using bots to harass, bait, or overwhelm channels.
- Trying to break bots, force error spam, or bypass cooldowns.

If a bot has a dedicated channel, use it there. And yes, you can still use /gambling and /rock-paper-scissors all you want, just try to keep things clean.


=== Pings and Notification Abuse (mentions) ===
~ Don’t weaponize notifications.

Not allowed:
- Ghost pinging (pinging then deleting or editing the message to remove it).
- Randomly pinging members just "because" or someone that told you to stop.
- Repeatedly pinging staff to pressure them (we have a life, just like you).
- Role pings or mass pings without a real need.

If you need staff help, ping once with a clear reason and include evidence when possible or DM Avenue Guard to automate the process.


=== Privacy and Personal Info (privacy) ===
~ Keep yourself and others safe.

Not allowed:
- Sharing anyone’s real name, address, phone number, school, workplace, photos, private accounts, or other identifying info.
- Hinting at someone’s city/school/job, posting partial info, "I know where you live"...
- Pressuring someone to reveal face/voice/age/location or to "prove" anything personal.
- Posting private DMs or call recordings publicly without consent.

If someone posts private info (even as a joke), staff will remove it immediately, punish involved accounts, and report them to other servers.
If you accidentally reveal your own info, tell staff so it can be handled quickly.

> Golden Rule: Do NOT share your personal information to anyone you don't know in real life and fully trust.  

=== Scams, Fraud, and Malicious Links (safety) ===
~ Don’t bring risky or shady behavior here.

Not allowed:
- Phishing links, fake giveaways, "free nitro" stuff...
- Attempts to steal accounts, tokens, or personal info.
- Selling stolen accounts, cracked software, or anything illegal.
- "Trust me bro" trading that puts others at risk.
- Anything that involves any type of private entity recluiting, paying, or offering anything to any individual.

If you suspect a scam, report it. Do not test the link or download the document, let staff handle it.


=== NSFW, Disturbing Content, and Borderline Messages (content) ===
~ Your content can be subject to deletion if anyone is uncomfortable.

Not allowed:
- Pornography, explicit sexual content, or fetish content.
- Gore or graphic content of any type.
- Sexual content, CSAM, abuse, or any type of showcase of violence.
- "Humor" that disgusts, scares, or disturbs others.

Borderline content that can still be punished:
- Highly suggestive images, "almost porn", explicit roleplay, or repeated sexual talk.
- "It’s censored" doesn’t make it acceptable if it’s still clearly explicit.
- Posting anything intentionally to make people uncomfortable.

> When in doubt: don’t post it.



=== Threats, Encouraging Harm, and Self-Harm (harm) ===
~ Keep people safe and don’t escalate real danger.

Not allowed:
- Threatening violence or harm (even "jokingly").
- Encouraging self-harm, suicide, eating-disorder behavior, or reckless decisions.
- Telling someone to kill themselves, "go die", "you should hurt yourself"...

If someone appears in danger, staff may intervene immediately and may restrict access to prevent escalation. If anyone you know is in danger, please call the emergency services or seek professional help immediately.


=== Impersonation, Alts, and Ban Evasion (accounts) ===
~ One identity, honest intent.

Not allowed:
- Rejoining on an alternate account after a ban, mute, or restriction to bypass said punishments.
- Impersonating ANYONE to trick people or cause drama.
- Using lookalike names, profile images, or bios to confuse others.

If you have a similar profile image, name, or bio to reference or parodize someone, make it clear you are not them.
If you were punished and want to appeal, use the proper route. Don’t dodge enforcement, it will only come back even harder.


=== Staff Direction, Warnings, and Punishment Drama (staff) ===
~ Staff direction isn’t optional.

Not allowed:
- Arguing moderation publicly or derailing chats with "why did I get muted?"
- Disrespecting moderators after receiving a punishment.
- Backseat moderating (acting like staff, ordering punishments, threatening bans when in fact you are not staff).
- Deliberately ignoring a warning by instantly repeating the behavior after it’s addressed (even if it was aimed at someone else).

If you think something was unfair, contact staff privately with context and stay calm. You can contact any admin (secretary), owner (mayor), head staff (police chief), or Avenue Guard for any of your concerns.


=== Conflict, Drama, and Server Atmosphere (conflict) ===
~ Don’t turn the server into a battleground.

Not allowed:
- Starting "callout posts" to rally people against someone (even if you have envidence).
- Bringing external drama from other servers or general social media and demanding sides.
- Vagueposting meant to provoke ("some of you are lazy…", "I won’t name names", "X thing really fits your attitude").
- Following someone across channels to continue an argument.

If you need to vent, do it privately. If you need action, report it with evidence.


=== Raiding and Organized Disruption (raids) ===
~ No coordinated attacks, inside or outside the server.

Not allowed:
- Coordinating spam, mass pings, or channel flooding.
- Encouraging others to harass a user, creator, or another server.
- "Let’s go dislike/spam/report" campaigns.

If you join the server for the purpose of causing chaos, expect an immediate ban.


=== Feedback Etiquette (feedback) ===
~ Feedback is structured. Keep it easy for all.

Please, read our pinned post titled "How to use this channel".

Rules:
- Don’t post levels for feedback outside the designated channel.
- Follow our format on how to ask for and give feedback.
- Don’t repost the same level repeatedly to farm validation or attention.
- Don’t trash levels with malicious intent, humiliation, or bait.

Good feedback expectations:
- Be specific (what works, what doesn’t, and why).
- Critique the level, NOT the creator.
- If someone asks you to stop critiquing, stop and move on.


=== Collaborations and Work (collabs) ===
~ Keep collabs respectful and organized.

Please, read our pinned post titled "How to use this channel".

Not allowed:
- Pressuring others into collabs, voice calls, or "prove you’re real".
- Begging or guilt-tripping for builds, deco, verify, art, or thumbnails.
- Demanding unpaid work or spamming requests after being told no.

We expect you ask for a user's works and experience as it is standard, but always be respectful and kind when asking if said user has not provided the necessary information.
If you offer or accept a collab, keep expectations clear and don’t start drama if someone declines.


=== Giveaways (giveaways) ===
~ No fake hype or scam behavior.

You can host a giveaway in our server by messaging any owner (mayor) with whatever you want to hand out.

Rules:
- Every giveaway must be honest and transparent.
- Don’t run giveaways that require inviting people, DMing strangers, clicking suspicious links, or any type of action apart from enrolling by using our giveaway bot.
- Don’t pressure members into not entering or entering the giveaway.
- Don´t giveaway things that are not understandable and realistically possible in your possesion.

Staff may stop or restrict any giveaways at any given time if they look unsafe.


=== Topics and conversations (etiquette) ===
~ Don’t force your topic everywhere.

Rules:
- Don’t derail active conversations repeatedly.
- Don’t use channels as meme dumps.
- Don’t bring feedback requests into unrelated channels.
- If a channel has a purpose, keep content aligned with it.

If staff says "move it", you move it. Repeated misuse becomes punishment.


=== Evidence, Reports, and helping (reports) ===
~ Don’t escalate, document.

If you try to handle stuff by yourself, you are not helping us, you are just disrupting things further.

When rules are broken:
- Don’t retaliate.
- Gather clear evidence (screenshots, message links, and recordings).
- Ping staff or DM Avenue Guard with a calm summary.

Not allowed:
- False reports.
- Edited "proof" meant to frame someone.
- Posting "evidence" publicly instead of reporting privately.


=== Staff Discretion and Edge Cases (discretion) ===
~ Not everything can be listed.

Rules can’t cover every scenario. Staff may act on behavior that is clearly disruptive, harmful, unsafe, or done in bad faith even if it’s not worded exactly here.

> If you’re the reason a new rule has to be written, expect severe action.


=== Reminder About Consequences (enforcement) ===
~ Being here means you accept enforcement.

Punishments may include warnings, mutes, kicks, bans, and content removal in any shape or form.
Severity depends on intent, impact, history, and cooperation.
Trying to dodge consequences (alts, manipulation, deleting messages...) can increase severity.
